As mentioned in [generating-github-pat.md](generating-github-pat.md "mention"), in order to use your generated PAT you have to create `.npmrc` file in project's `root` directory.

If you have already generated PAT and have created `.npmrc` file in one project, you can copy the file to other projects

## 1. Create .npmrc file

```bash
$: cd ./crucible
$: touch .npmrc # make .npmrc file in root
```

## 2. Update .npmrc file content

```bash
# .npmrc
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=PAT_TOKEN_HERE
@exile-watch:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```
