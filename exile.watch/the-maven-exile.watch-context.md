# The Maven - exile.watch context

Being a cosmic entity yourself _(as a human)_, you essentially serve as an observer _(akin to an exile.watch user)._

You witness encounters through GIF snippets, much like Maven observes your PoE endeavors.

***

The main project of `exile.watch` is named [crucible](projects/crucible/) - this is your arena _(the website)_ where you witness all the battles.&#x20;

To gain entry into the `crucible`, you need Maven's Writ. The `exile.watch` [writ](projects/writ/) project contains components and icons that allow the `crucible` to exist.&#x20;

To obtain a Maven's Writ, you need [splinters](projects/splinters/) - this is where the `exile.watch` build tools create `writ` packages.

All the information served to `crucible` resides in the `exile.watch` [nucleus](projects/nucleus/) project, just like all the information The Maven processes through her Nucleus.
