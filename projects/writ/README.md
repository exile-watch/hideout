Without [_(The Maven's)_ Writ](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/The\_Maven's\_Writ) there is no [_(The Maven's)_ Crucible](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/The\_Maven's\_Crucible)

Similarly, without a [design system](https://github.com/exile-watch/writ) there is no [user facing website](https://github.com/exile-watch/crucible).

***

`writ` design system is based on real-world codebases.

`writ` design system provides UI components to help contributors work more efficiently, and to make _Writ_ modules more cohesive.

While `writ` design system is not yet accessibility friendly as well as not thoroughly tested, this will be changed in the future.

Aim of the `writ` design system is to provide high quality experience for both, developers and users, that effortlessly scales across _Writ_ modules.

`writ` design system is intended for all platforms and latest browsers. This may not be the case in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase, but it sets a ground up for the future.
